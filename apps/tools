These IDEs help in writing, debugging, and organizing the Python code for the rule engine.
Both support essential features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, version control, and virtual environments, making them suitable for handling Flask projects.

2)Postman:

Postman is used for testing the REST API endpoints in the application (e.g., /create_rule, /modify_rule).
It allows you to send HTTP requests, check responses, and validate error handling for different test cases.
