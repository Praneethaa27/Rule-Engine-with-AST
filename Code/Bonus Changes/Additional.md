To implement the requested features in your rule engine application, we’ll make several enhancements, including error handling, validations, and modifications for existing rules. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how to achieve this:

1. Error Handling for Invalid Rule Strings or Data Formats
We'll need to validate the rule strings and their formats to ensure they follow expected patterns.

2. Validations for Attributes
Define a catalog of valid attributes and ensure that any rule string uses these attributes.

3. Modification of Existing Rules
Implement functions that allow for the modification of existing rules, including changing operators or operand values.

Updated Code Implementation
Below is a modified version of your existing code with the new features added:
1. app2.py
2. models/rule_model2.py

Explanation of Key Changes
Error Handling:

The is_valid_rule function checks the rule string for valid operators and basic structure. You can extend this to check for specific patterns or structures.
Rule Modification:

The api_modify_rule endpoint allows modification of an existing rule. It validates the new rule string before updating the rule in the database.
Attribute Validations:

You may create a more comprehensive attribute catalog to validate attributes in your rule strings.
Generate Rule AST:

A placeholder function generate_rule_ast is included. You should implement your logic to create an Abstract Syntax Tree from the rule string.
Next Steps
Advanced Validations: Enhance is_valid_rule to include more sophisticated checks for rule structure.
User-Defined Functions: While outside the current scope, consider how you might implement this in the future.
Testing: Use Postman to test your new endpoints (/create_rule and /modify_rule) with various valid and invalid rule strings.
