1. ***app.py*** - **Main Entry Point (API Layer)**
- This file initializes the Flask application, defines API routes, and connects to the backend services.

2. ***config.py*** - **Configuration**
- This file stores the database connection and environment configuration.

3. ***models/rule_model.py*** - **Database Schema (ORM)**
- This file defines the Rule model and interacts with the database using an ORM (like SQLAlchemy).

4. ***services/rule_service.py*** - **Business Logic for Rules**
- This file implements the core logic for rule creation, combination, and evaluation.

5. ***utils/ast_utils.py*** - **AST Helper Functions**
- This file contains utility functions to handle AST creation, traversal, and evaluation.

6. ***frontend/index.html*** - **Simple Frontend (Optional)**
- This file serves as a basic UI where users can input rules and test them.

7. ***tests/test_rule_engine.py*** - **Unit Tests**
- This file contains unit tests for the rule engine functionality.

8. ***requirements.txt*** - **Python Dependencies**
- List the required Python packages for your project

#### Explanation:
- **app.py**: Main API handling requests for creating, combining, and evaluating rules.
- **config.py**: Stores configuration details like database connection strings.
- **rule_model.py**: Defines the schema for storing rules in the database using SQLAlchemy.
- **rule_service.py**: Core business logic for managing rules (create, combine, evaluate).
- **ast_utils.py**: Utility functions to manage AST creation, combination, and evaluation.
- **index.html**: A simple user interface for creating and testing rules.
- **test_rule_engine.py**: Unit tests to ensure each part of the rule engine works as expected.
